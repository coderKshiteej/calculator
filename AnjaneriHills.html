        <span style="text-align: center; padding: 0px 100px;">Anjaneri Hills, located near Nashik in the state of Maharashtra, India, is a significant landmark known for its natural beauty and religious importance. Here is some detailed information about Anjaneri Hills:
            
            Location:
            Anjaneri Hills are situated in the Western Ghats, about 20 kilometers from Nashik city. The hills are named after Anjani, the mother of Lord Hanuman, who is believed to have been born here.
            
            Scenic Beauty:
            Anjaneri Hills offer breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding lush greenery, valleys, and waterfalls. The hills are covered with dense forests and have a tranquil and serene atmosphere, making them a popular destination for nature lovers, trekkers, and photographers.A little off the territory of Nashik, Anjaneri Mountains offers the right amount of solitude and peace from the fussy city life. But reaching here is a big task. Tourists will have to first take a bus from Nashik to reach Trimbakeshwar, and further trek for another 10 kilometers to reach the Anjaneri mountain. It will be tad tedious but the promising view that one gets to see worth all the efforts.

            Anjaneri Parvat is quite significant amongst the devotees as locals say that the cave on the top of the hill was the place where Goddess Anjana gave birth to Lord Hanuman. And that's how the mountain got its name. Along with the cave, believed to be the place where Lord Hanuman was born, there's Anajani Mata temple. A lot of other places associated with the life of Lord Hanuman are also there, which can be seen while trekking on the hill. One such place is a cave, which is believed to be the spot where Lord Pawan Dev took Bal Hanuman when he was hit by the 'vajra' of Lord Indra. Also, there is a Mata Anjana temple; the place where Goddess Anjani meditated for a kid, and Shiva ultimately appeared in front of her to bless a boon. There are two pindies inside the temple; the big one is of Mata Anjana and the small one is of Bal Hanuman. A cave decorated with inscriptions that are as old as 1000 years also appears while trekking on the hill.</span>
