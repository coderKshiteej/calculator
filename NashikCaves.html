    <span  style="text-align: center; padding: 0px 100px;">Nashik Caves, also known as Pandulena Caves, are a group of ancient rock-cut caves located in Nashik, Maharashtra, India. These caves hold great historical and archaeological significance and are believed to date back to the 1st century BCE. They were used as viharas (monastic dwellings) for Buddhist monks during ancient times.
        Nashik Caves are situated on the outskirts of Nashik city, specifically on the Trivashmi Hill. The hill is named after the mythological sage Trivashmi, who is believed to have resided there.
        The caves were carved out of basalt rock, and there are a total of 24 caves in the complex. These caves exhibit fine examples of ancient Buddhist rock-cut architecture. Each cave has a distinctive layout, featuring a central hall or shrine, cells for meditation or accommodation, and intricate carvings on the walls and pillars.
        The walls of the Nashik Caves are adorned with beautiful sculptures and carvings, depicting various Buddhist symbols, gods, and goddesses. The intricate artistry reflects the skill and craftsmanship of the ancient artisans. The carvings also depict scenes from the life of Lord Buddha and stories from Buddhist scriptures.
        When visiting Nashik Caves, it is advisable to wear comfortable shoes as there might be some climbing involved. The caves are easily accessible, and there is no entry fee. The natural surroundings and serene ambiance of the caves make it a peaceful place for meditation and reflection.The Nasik Caves,[1] or Trirashmi Leni (Trirashmi being the name of the hills in which the caves are located, Leni being a Marathi word for caves), are a group of 23 caves carved between the 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE, though additional sculptures were added up to about the 6th century, reflecting changes in Buddhist devotional practices.[2][3] The Buddhist sculptures are a significant group of early examples of Indian rock-cut architecture initially representing the Early Buddhist schools tradition.

        Most of the caves are viharas except for Cave 18 which is a chaitya of the 1st century BCE by Sunga dynasty.[2] The style of some of the elaborate pillars or columns, for example in caves 3 and 10, is an important example of the development of the form.[4] The location of the caves is a holy Buddhist site and is located about 8 km south of the centre of Nashik (or Nasik), Maharashtra, India. The Pandavleni name sometimes given to the Nasik Caves has nothing to do with the Pandavas, characters in the Mahabharata epic. Other caves in the area are Karla Caves, Bhaja Caves, Patan Cave and Bedse Caves.
