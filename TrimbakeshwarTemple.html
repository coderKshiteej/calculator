                Trimbakeshwar Temple has a long history dating back to ancient times. It is believed that the temple was built by various rulers over different periods. The current structure of the temple was constructed by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao (Nanasaheb Peshwa) in the 18th century.<br>
                Unique Features:
                Trimbakeshwar Temple has several unique features that make it distinct. One of the remarkable aspects is that the lingam here represents the Trimurti, the trinity of Hindu gods - Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The lingam has three faces representing each of these deities.As per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.[6] To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The Jyotirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.[7][8] Originally there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy.[6] Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva.[9] At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.[9][10][11] The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Trimbakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Nageshwar Temple at Dwaraka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.[6][12]
